Yes. Fraunces pairs well with Inter if you use Fraunces only for display and keep the rest Inter.

Guidelines to make it feel intentional (not decorative):
	•	Use Fraunces for H1 only (and optionally H2). Keep H3 and body in Inter.
	•	Prefer Fraunces “Soft” or “Roman” styles, not the most ornate ones.
	•	Use moderate weights: Fraunces 500–600 for headings. Inter 400–500 body, 600 buttons.
	•	Keep line lengths short and add a bit of spacing around the H1 so the serif feels premium, not busy.
	•	Avoid using Fraunces inside glass cards for dense text. Headings only.

Practical pairing setup (Next.js):
	•	Headings: Fraunces
	•	Body/UI: Inter

If your site is dark and minimal, choose Fraunces with slightly tighter tracking (or no extra tracking) and keep Inter crisp. This combination fits the “modern but heritage” vibe and still reads like a serious technical project.
